P**sScripts**

Welcome to the **PsScripts** repository! This collection is designed to share PowerShell scripts that simplify repetitive administrative tasks.

**Purpose**
Many of the scripts here automate tasks that would otherwise take longer to complete manually, such as logging in, navigating through menus, or performing system administration tasks. Instead of repeating these steps, you can simply run a script (./script) and let it handle the job for you.

**Folder Structure**
The scripts in this repository are organized into the following folders:

**AzureAD:**
Scripts related to managing users and groups in Azure Active Directory. These include tasks such as exporting user group memberships or managing user properties.

**ActiveDirectory:**
Scripts for managing on-premises Active Directory, including tasks such as comparing group memberships, updating user details, and other AD-related administrative tasks.

**MFA:**
Scripts specifically focused on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), auditing user MFA methods and configurations, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

**GeneralAdmin:**
General scripts that donâ€™t fit into a specific service category. These include administrative tasks such as restoring OneDrive sites or resetting user credentials across hybrid environments.

**Disclaimer**
I am not a programmer by trade; these scripts are the result of practical needs and experience in IT administration. While they may not follow formal coding practices, they are designed to be functional and efficient for the tasks at hand. I hope you find them useful!

**Use Cases**
These scripts can be especially helpful for:

Automating routine administrative tasks
Reducing the time spent on repetitive processes
Enhancing productivity for system administrators and IT professionals

**Contribution**
Feel free to suggest improvements or share feedback. If you find a script helpful or have a way to make it better, contributions are welcome!
