Welcome to the PsScripts repository! This collection is designed to share PowerShell scripts that simplify repetitive administrative tasks.

Purpose
Many of the scripts here automate tasks that would otherwise take longer to complete manually, such as logging in, navigating through menus, or performing system administration tasks. Instead of repeating these steps, you can simply run a script (./script) and let it handle the job for you.

Disclaimer
I am not a programmer by trade; these scripts are the result of practical needs and experience in IT administration. While they may not follow formal coding practices, they are designed to be functional and efficient for the tasks at hand. I hope you find them useful!

Use Cases
These scripts can be especially helpful for:

Automating routine administrative tasks
Reducing the time spent on repetitive processes
Enhancing productivity for system administrators and IT professionals
Contribution
Feel free to suggest improvements or share feedback. If you find a script helpful or have a way to make it better, contributions are welcome!
