# --------------------------------------------
# Script Name: Reset-AzureADUser.ps1
# Purpose: To reset an Azure AD user account in the event of compromise. This script handles:
# - Password resets
# - Blocking sign-ins
# - Revoking active sessions
# - Resetting MFA registrations
# - Removing app-specific passwords (for legacy applications)
#
# Intended Audience: IT administrators responsible for managing Azure Active Directory users,
# especially in security or incident response scenarios where a user account is suspected of being compromised.
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Make sure to have both AzureAD and MSOnline modules installed.
# 2. Run this script with administrative privileges.
# 3. Provide the User Principal Name (email address) of the compromised user when prompted.
# 4. The script will handle resetting the user's account and securing it.
# 5. If multiple users need to be reset, rerun the script for each user to ensure consistency.

# Function: Reset-AzureADUser
# This function handles the core steps to reset and secure a compromised Azure AD user account.
# Steps:
# 1. Check if the user exists in Azure AD.
# 2. Reset the user's password twice (as an extra security measure).
# 3. Block the user's sign-in to prevent further access.
# 4. Revoke all active sessions (includes signing the user out of all devices).
# 5. Remove app-specific passwords (for legacy applications using basic auth).
# 6. Reset the user's MFA registration to force re-registration of MFA devices.
